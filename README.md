# IEEE-Batch-Downloader

Because the IEEE site only allows downloading up to 10 PDFs at a time, a browser extension was created to enable batch selection of papers and automate the download process

# Features
- Select multiple IEEE papers across search results

- Queue and auto-download


# ⚠️Attention
This tool respects and does not intend to infringe IEEE's copyrights. All operations are performed using the buttons and operation APIs already present on the web pages. Therefore, please note the following when using this tool：
1. For articles without access permissions, **this tool cannot bypass access restrictions or enable literature downloads via alternative links**. Therefore, when using this tool to download articles, please ensure you possess the necessary access permissions.
2. Please be mindful of your access frequency to avoid triggering the IEEE platform's bulk download protection mechanism due to excessive short-term visits or excessive literature downloads.
